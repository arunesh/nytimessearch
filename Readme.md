# Project 2 - *NyTimesSearch*

**NyTimesSearch** is an android app that allows a user to search for articles on web using simple filters. The app utilizes [New York Times Search API](http://developer.nytimes.com/docs/read/article_search_api_v2).

Time spent: **10** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [X] User can **search for news article** by specifying a query and launching a search. Search displays a grid of image results from the New York Times Search API.
* [X] User can click on "settings" which allows selection of **advanced search options** to filter results
* [X] User can configure advanced search filters such as:

  * [X] News desk values (Arts, Fashion & Style, Sports)
  * [X] Sort order (oldest or newest)
